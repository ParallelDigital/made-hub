# How to Use the Roster Email Button

## For Recurring Classes (Like "BUILT BY BARBELL")

### ✅ Correct Way:
1. Go to Admin → Classes (calendar or list view)
2. **Click on the specific date** you want to send roster for
   - Example: Click "BUILT BY BARBELL" on November 18
3. You'll see the class page with that specific date (URL: `/admin/classes/72?date=2024-11-18`)
4. Click "Send Roster Email" button
5. Modal shows: "Date: Monday, November 18, 2024"
6. Enter email address (or use instructor's default)
7. Click "Send Email"
8. ✅ Email shows correct roster: "3/10" for that specific date

### ❌ Wrong Way:
- Don't click "Send Roster Email" from the parent class page without a date
- If you do, you'll see a yellow warning telling you to select a date first

## For Non-Recurring Classes

1. Go to the class page
2. Click "Send Roster Email" button
3. Enter email address
4. Click "Send Email"
5. Done!

## What the Email Shows

The email will include:
- **Subject:** "New Booking: BUILT BY BARBELL — Mon 18 Nov 2024 10:00 (3/10)"
- **Correct date** for the class occurrence
- **Correct booking count** for that specific date
- **List of attendees** booked for that date
- Instructor name and class details

## Tips

- **Always navigate to the specific date first** for recurring classes
- The button uses whatever date you're currently viewing
- You can send to any email address (not just the instructor)
- The date is shown in the modal so you can verify before sending
